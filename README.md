# Movie-Central-A-Single-Page-App-using-TMDB

## Project Overview

Movie-Central-A-Single-Page-App-using-TMDB: A Personal Movie Database

Movie-Central-A-Single-Page-App-using-TMDB is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to search for and browse movies from the TMDB API. Users can also create an account and add their favorite movies to a watchlist. The application features a login module, a trending movies module, a search module, a logout module, and an add to favorites module.

Currently, the application fetches and displays the following data for each trending movie:

. Movie overview
. Number of ratings
. Genre
. Release date

I have used SnackBarService to show messages at the bottom of the application with swiping enabled. I have also used this service to prevent users from accessing the favorite module once they have logged out.

I am still under development, but I am excited to continue adding new features and functionality to Movie-Central-A-Single-Page-App-using-TMDB. I hope that this application will become a valuable resource for movie lovers of all ages.
